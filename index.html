			<h2>The Story</h2>
			<p>
			 Many years into the future, robots have replaced humans for all physical labor.  Presidential elections are decided by how well candidates can use the robots at their disposal to accomplish a task.  This election cycle, you are competing against another candidate to build the highest tower possible.  Whoever reaches the total number of tower bricks first wins the election.

				<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
				<p>In Easy Mode, your goal is to construct bricks faster than the rival candidate.  Your units are on the left, and rival units are on the right.  You use diamonds to buy miners and builders.  Miners gather diamonds faster, and builders construct bricks faster.</p>
				<p>Arrow keys of the keyboard are used to move your destroyer UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT on the main screen.</p>
				<p>Good luck, and may the best candidate win!</p>

				<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
				<p>In Hard Mode, your goal is to construct bricks faster than the rival candidate.  Your units are on the left, and rival units are on the right.  You use diamonds to buy miners, builders, and destroyers.  Miners gather diamonds faster, builders construct bricks faster, and destroyers damage rival units.  The rival candidate can buy destroyers as well, so you need to guard against those units while still building faster than the rival candidate.</p>
				<p>Good luck, and may the best candidate win!</p>
